# HomeWorks_3
C++ language. 01/11/2017 - 28/12/2017

This repository contains 3 independent home works I did on 'Algorithms and Graphs' course of my 3-semester study at Czech Technical University in Prague.

All of these were made on Ubuntu using 'gcc' (version 4.8.4) compiler.

Task description, sample runs, and submission results are included in the end of each code in the end as a comment.
